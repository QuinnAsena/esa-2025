  abstract = {Oscillations of Pinus (pine) pollen in a 50,000-year sequence from Lake Tulane, Florida, indicate that there were major vegetation shifts during the last glacial cycle. Episodes of abundant Pinus populations indicate a climate that was more wet than intervening phases dominated by Quercus (oak) and Ambrosia-type (ragweed and marsh-elder). The Pinus episodes seem to be temporally correlated with the North Atlantic Heinrich events, which were massive, periodic advances of ice streams from the eastern margin of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Possible links between the Tulane Pinus and Heinrich events include hemispheric cooling, the influences of Mississippi meltwater on sea-surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, and the effects of North Atlantic thermohaline circulation on currents in the Gulf.}

  abstract = {Analyses of pollen and plant macrofossils from a new core spanning the past 60,000 years from Lake Tulane, Florida show a strong antiphase relationship in temperature between Florida and the North Atlantic region. During the Pleistocene, oak-scrub and prairie phases were coeval with long, intense Dansgaard--Oeschger interstadials (warm periods) that initiated Bond cycles. Pine phases were coeval with the North Atlantic long stadials (cold periods) that ended Bond cycles and were terminated by Heinrich events. Lake levels were higher during pine phases, and climate was wetter. However, climate in Florida was also warmer during these phases, which were cold periods in the North Atlantic. Perhaps diminution of thermohaline circulation before and during Heinrich events reduced northward heat transport and retained warmth in the subtropical Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico.},
